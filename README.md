# React To Do List Maker

A "To Do" list application built in React. User can type in new tasks and add them to the list by either hitting "Return" on the keyboard or clicking the "Create" button. Tasks are added to a vertical list with option buttons for editing the task name, deleting the task, or marking it as complete. The "Completed" button is a toggle, so a user can also return them to an incomplete status.

When entering tasks, the application prevents you from trying to click "Create" with nothing in the box. It also checks to see if your task is already on the list, and prevents this while giving the user a notification of the issue.

On mobile devices, the task list responsively shifts from the right to under the task creation box.
